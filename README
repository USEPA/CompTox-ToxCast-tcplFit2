### tcplfit2: A Concentration-Response Modeling Utility

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the tcplfit2 package.

The R package tcplfit2 is used to perform basic concentration response curve fitting. The original tcplFit() functions in the ToxCast Pipeline (tcpl) package performed basic concentration response curve fitting to 3 models. With tcplfit2, the core concentration-response functionality of the package tcpl has been expanded built to process high-throughput screen (HTS) data generated at the US Environmental Protection Agency, including targeted ToxCast, high-throughput transcriptomics (HTTr) and high-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP) screening results.

If you are interested in contributing or want to report a bug, please submit a issue or start a discussion. 

To install the current development version, run the following command: 

    devtools::install_github("USEPA/CompTox-ToxCast-tcplfit2")
