## Welcome to the GitHub repository for the tcplfit2 package.

<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcplfit2/index.html"><img src="vignettes/img/tcplfit2_hex.png" width="200" align="right" /></a>

The tcplfit2 R package performs basic concentration-response curve fitting. The original tcplFit() function in the [ToxCast Pipeline (tcpl) R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcpl/index.html) performed basic concentration-response curvefitting to 3 models. With tcplfit2, the core tcpl concentration-response functionality has been expanded to process diverse high-throughput screen (HTS) data generated at the US Environmental Protection Agency, including targeted ToxCast, high-throughput transcriptomics (HTTr) and high-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP). tcplfit2 can be used independently to support analysis for diverse chemical screening efforts.

If you are interested in contributing or want to report a bug, please submit a issue or start a discussion. 

To install the current development version, run the following command: 

    devtools::install_github("USEPA/CompTox-ToxCast-tcplfit2")
