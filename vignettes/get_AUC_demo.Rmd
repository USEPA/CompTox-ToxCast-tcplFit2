# Introduction

Please note, this AUC calculation in `tcplfit2` is a beta functionality still under development and review, and as such, we welcome your feedback.

This vignette explores how to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) for concentration-response curves with `tcplfit2` using the parameters from curve fitting in the integration to estimate an AUC. The AUC can be interpreted as a measure of overall efficacy and potency, which users may want to include as part of their analyses, such as analyses that aim to rank or prioritize chemical by activity.

A consideration in applying this function get_AUC() is whether the model bounds are on a log10-scale or arithmetic scale. The use of log10-scale or arithmethic scale may change interpretation of the AUC value. In lines 76-126 of the get_AUC.R function, the methods for converting curve fit model parameters to the log10 scale are provided and in the get_AUC() function, use.log is a logical option that is FALSE by default.

# Area Under the Curve (AUC) with `concRespCore` 

The `concRespCore` function has a logical argument `AUC` controlling whether the area under the curve (AUC) is calculated for the winning model and returned alongside the other modeling results (e.g. model parameters and hit-call details). This argument defaults to `FALSE`, such that the AUC will only be included in the output when the users requested it (i.e. `AUC=TRUE`).

```{r example 1}
# some example data
conc <- list(.03, .1, .3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100)
resp <- list(0, .2, .1, .4, .7, .9, .6, 1.2)
row <- list(conc = conc,
            resp = resp,
            bmed = 0,
            cutoff = 1,
            onesd = .5)

# AUC is included in the output
concRespCore(row, conthits = TRUE, AUC = TRUE)
```

The following sections demonstrate how to estimate the AUC when curve fitting is performed with `concRespCore` as well as via separate calls using `tcplfit2_core` and `tcplhit2_core`.  Additionally, several types of potential curve fits with the resulting AUC are highlighted with context to help with interpretation.

## Positive Responses {#positivecurve}

This section provides an example of how to use `get_AUC` function in `tcplfit2` to calculate area under the curves (AUC) for a given concentration-response curve. First, example data is obtained and curve-fit. 

```{r example 2, fig.height = 4.55, fig.width = 8}
# This is taken from the example under tcplfit2_core
conc_ex2 <- c(.03, .1, .3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100)
resp_ex2 <- c(0, .1, 0, .2, .6, .9, 1.1, 1)

# fit all available models in the package
# show all fitted curves 
output_ex2 <- tcplfit2_core(conc_ex2, resp_ex2, .8)
grid.arrange(plot_allcurves(output_ex2, conc_ex2, resp_ex2),
          plot_allcurves(output_ex2, conc_ex2, resp_ex2, log_conc = TRUE), ncol = 2)
```

***Figure 1:** This figure depicts all fit concentration-response curves. The models are polynomial 1 and 2, power, hill, gain-loss, and exponential 2 to exponential 5.*

The `get_AUC` function can be used to calculate the AUC for a single model. Inputs to this function are: the name of the model, lower and upper concentration bounds (usually the lowest and the highest concentrations in the data, respectively), and the estimated model parameters. The code chunk below demonstrates how to calculate AUC for the hill model, starting by extracting information from the `tcplfit2_core` output then inputting this information into the `get_AUC` function. After estimating the AUC, the hill curve is plot and corresponding region under the curve is shaded.


```{r example 2 cont., fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
fit_method <- "hill"
# extract the parameters 
modpars <- output_ex2[[fit_method]][output_ex2[[fit_method]]$pars]

# plug into get_AUC function 
estimated_auc1 <- get_AUC(fit_method, min(conc_ex2), max(conc_ex2), modpars)
estimated_auc1

# extract the predicted responses from the model
pred_resp <- output_ex2[[fit_method]][["modl"]]

# plot to see if the result make sense
# the shaded area is what the function tries to find
plot(conc_ex2, pred_resp)
lines(conc_ex2, pred_resp)
polygon(c(conc_ex2, max(conc_ex2)), c(pred_resp, min(pred_resp)), col=rgb(1, 0, 0,0.5))
```

***Figure 2:** The red shaded region is the area under the fitted hill curve. The AUC estimated with `get_AUC` is `r round(estimated_auc1,5)`. This estimate seems to align with the area of the shaded region. *

AUC can be calculated for other models with exception of the constant model.

```{r example 2 other models}
# list of models
fitmodels = c("gnls", "poly1", "poly2", "pow", "exp2", "exp3", "exp4", "exp5")
mylist <- list()
for (model in fitmodels){

  fit_method <- model
  # extract corresponding model parameters
  modpars <- output_ex2[[fit_method]][output_ex2[[fit_method]]$pars]
  
  # get AUC
  mylist[[fit_method]] <- get_AUC(fit_method, min(conc_ex2), max(conc_ex2), modpars)
  
}
# print AUC's for other models 
data.frame(mylist,row.names = "AUC")
```

## Negative Responses


This section demonstrates the behavior of the `get_AUC` function with negative response curves. Here, example data is pulled from example 3 in the [tcplfit2 Introduction Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcplfit2/vignettes/tcplfit2-vignette.html). 

```{r example 3, fig.height = 4.55, fig.width = 8}
# Taking the code from example 3 in the vignette 
library(stringr)  # string management package
data("signatures")

# use row 5 in the data
conc=as.numeric(str_split(signatures[5,"conc"],"\\|")[[1]])
resp=as.numeric(str_split(signatures[5,"resp"],"\\|")[[1]])
cutoff=signatures[5,"cutoff"]

# plot all models, this is an example of negative curves 
output_negative <- tcplfit2_core(conc, resp, cutoff)
grid.arrange(plot_allcurves(output_negative, conc, resp),
          plot_allcurves(output_negative, conc, resp, log_conc = TRUE), ncol = 2)
```
***Figure 3:** This plot depicts all fitted concentration-response curves. All curves show decreasing responses starting from 0 and below x-axis. *

```{r example 3 cont., fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
fit_method <- "exp3"

# extract corresponding model parameters and predicted response
modpars <- output_negative[[fit_method]][output_negative[[fit_method]]$pars]
pred_resp <- output_negative[[fit_method]][["modl"]]

estimated_auc2 <- get_AUC(fit_method, min(conc), max(conc), modpars)
estimated_auc2

# plot this curve
pred_resp <- pred_resp[order(conc)]
plot(conc[order(conc)], pred_resp)
lines(conc[order(conc)], pred_resp)
polygon(c(conc[order(conc)], max(conc)), c(pred_resp, max(pred_resp)), col=rgb(1, 0, 0,0.5))
```

***Figure 4:** Notice the function returns a negative AUC value, `r round(estimated_auc2, 5)`. The absolute value, `r abs(round(estimated_auc2,5))`, seems to align with the area between the curve and x-axis. Note: The x-axis in this plot is in the original units, so it looks different from the curve in figure 3, which has the x-axis in $log_{10}$ units.*

As demonstrated, when integrating over a curve in the negative direction, the function will return a negative AUC value. However, some users may want to consider all "areas" as positive values. For this reason, the `return.abs = TRUE` argument in `get_AUC` converts negative AUC values to positive values when returned. This argument is by default `FALSE`.

```{r example 3 convert negative AUC}
get_AUC(fit_method, min(conc), max(conc), modpars, return.abs = TRUE) 
```

## Bi-phasic Responses

Currently, the polynomial 2 model in `tcplfit2` is capable of fitting bi-phasic curves, but these polynomial 2 curve fits (as implemented in the `tcplfit2` package) are bounded such that the baseline response is always assumed to be 0. This section demonstrates what happens if a user did want to estimate the AUC for a simulated bi-phasic curve that has area below and above the x-axis. 


The Polynomial 2 model in `tcplfit2` is implemented as $a*(\frac{x}{b} + \frac{x^2}{b^2})$. Here, $a = 1$ and $b = (-2)$ is used to simulate a bi-phasic curve, which can be represented in the typical form as $\frac{1}{4} x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x$.

```{r example 4, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# simulate a poly2 curve
conc_sim <- seq(0,3, length.out = 100)
## biphasic poly2 parameters
b1 <- -1.3
b2 <- 0.7
## converted to tcplfit2's poly2 parameters
a <- b1^2/b2
b <- b1/b2

## plot the curve
resp_sim <- poly2(c(a, b, 0.1), conc_sim)
plot(conc_sim, resp_sim)
abline(h = 0)
```

***Figure 5:** This plot illustrates the simulated bi-phasic polynomial 2 curve. The curve initially decreases, then increases and crosses the x-axis at `x = 2` (x-intercept).*

```{r, example 4 cont.}
# get AUC for the simulated Polynomial 2 curve 
get_AUC("poly2", min(conc_sim), max(conc_sim), ps = c(a, b))
```

Integrating over a curve with area above and below the x-axis, the current function returns the difference between the total area above the x-axis and the total area below the x-axis (i.e. blue region minus red region). In this example, area above the x-axis is slightly larger than the area below the x-axis so the function returned a positive difference.   

Since the AUC is used as an indicator of overall effect size in a toxicological context, then it makes more sense to report the total area of the above and below x-axis (i.e., blue region plus red region) for bi-phasic curves. To do that, we need to calculate each area separately and take the sum of those areas. The code below demonstrate how this is done for the previously simulated polynomial 2 curve. It should be noted, one needs to identify where the x-intercept(s) occur in order to calculate each area. In this example, the non-zero x-intercept is at x = `r round((-b1-b1)/(2*b2), 3)`. 

```{r, example 4 cont.2}
# calculate area of each section separately and then sum them together 
x_intercept <- 1.857
total_auc <- abs(get_AUC("poly2", min(conc_sim), x_intercept, ps = c(a, b))) + 
  get_AUC("poly2", x_intercept, max(conc_sim), ps = c(a, b))
total_auc
```

The total area of red region plus blue region is `r total_auc`. 

# AUC with `tcplfit2_core` and `tcplhit2_core`

In some cases, users may want to run the `tcplfit2_core` and `tcplhit2_core` functions separately, and only obtain the AUC for the winning model from `tcplhit2_core`. Thus, `tcplfit2` also includes a wrapper function for `get_AUC`, called `post_hit_AUC`, which allows users to estimate the AUC for the winning model only.

`tcplhit2_core` provides output in a data frame format with a single row containing the concentration-response data, the winning model name along with the fitted parameter values, and hit-calling results. The code chunk below provides an example demonstrating how to use the wrapper function `post_hit_AUC`. Internally, the wrapper function extracts information from the one-row data frame output and pass it to `get_AUC`, which calculates the AUC. Thus, manual entry of the model name, parameters values, etc. into `get_AUC` is not necessary with `post_hit_AUC`.

The winning model from the [Positive Responses](#positivecurve) example is the Hill model. Comparing the AUC from the previous example and the AUC returned from the `post_hit_AUC` here should be identical, i.e. `r round(estimated_auc1,5)`.

```{r example 5}
out <- tcplhit2_core(output_ex2, conc_ex2, resp_ex2, 0.8, onesd = 0.4)
out
post_hit_AUC(out)
```
