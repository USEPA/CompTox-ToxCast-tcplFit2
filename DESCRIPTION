Description: This package performs the basic concentration-response curve fitting used in teh EPA tcpl package.
    It is a substitute for the original tcplFit function (and sub-functions) and allows a wider variety
    of concenttaion-response models. All of the models included in the BMDExpress package are now part of this,
    and the output includes a calculation of the bmd (Benchmark Dse or concentration) value
