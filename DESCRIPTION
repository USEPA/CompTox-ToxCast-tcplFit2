Description: Performs the basic concentration response curve fitting used 
    in the 'tcpl' package. It is a substitute for the original tcplFit() function 
    (and sub-functions) and allows a wider variety of concentration-response models. 
    All of the models included in the 'BMDExpress' package are now part of this package,
    and the output includes a calculation of the bmd (Benchmark Dose or concentration) 
    value.
